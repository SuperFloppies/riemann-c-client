* 1.0.1 - UNRELEASED

This release is a minor enhancement over the initial 1.0.0 release,
containing only a few improvements to error handling, including a fix
for a resource leak on event creation and connection failure.

All of _free() functions should now behave similarly, and set errno
to EINVAL when passed a NULL pointer.

The source also comes with a way to easily extract code coverage
information too, simply by typing `make coverage`.

* 1.0.0 - <2013-06-28 Fri>
