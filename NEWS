* 1.0.3 - <2013-12-08 Sun>

Minor internal changes were made to the library, in the spirit of
future extensibility. There were no functional changes made, however.

The riemann-client tool did receive a lot more updates again, though,
and now has support for returning query results in JSON (if the
json-c library is installed when compiling the package).

* 1.0.2 - <2013-11-23 Sat>

The library has not been touched at all with this release, but the
riemann-client tool received some updates and a manual page.

* 1.0.1 - <2013-08-11 Sun>

This release is a minor enhancement over the initial 1.0.0 release,
containing only a few improvements to error handling, including a fix
for a resource leak on event creation and connection failure.

All of _free() functions should now behave similarly, and set errno
to EINVAL when passed a NULL pointer.

The source also comes with a way to easily extract code coverage
information too, simply by typing `make coverage`.

* 1.0.0 - <2013-06-28 Fri>

Initial public release.
