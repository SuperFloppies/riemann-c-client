* 1.1.1 - <2014-01-23 Thu>

While the riemann-client tool had the code to return query results in
JSON format since 1.0.3, it was not correctly wired into the build
system, and was always disabled. This release corrects that issue.

* 1.1.0 - <2013-12-22 Sun>

The major feature of this release is the simplified API available in
the <riemann/simple.h> header. The new API is for use when the whole
message can be constructed in a single step, and losing some of the
flexibility the library provides is not a problem.

Apart from that, a few bugs were also fixed in this release, such as
receiving events will now always wait for the full event. The test
suite was also made completely optional.

* 1.0.3 - <2013-12-08 Sun>

Minor internal changes were made to the library, in the spirit of
future extensibility. There were no functional changes made, however.

The riemann-client tool did receive a lot more updates again, though,
and now has support for returning query results in JSON (if the
json-c library is installed when compiling the package).

* 1.0.2 - <2013-11-23 Sat>

The library has not been touched at all with this release, but the
riemann-client tool received some updates and a manual page.

* 1.0.1 - <2013-08-11 Sun>

This release is a minor enhancement over the initial 1.0.0 release,
containing only a few improvements to error handling, including a fix
for a resource leak on event creation and connection failure.

All of _free() functions should now behave similarly, and set errno
to EINVAL when passed a NULL pointer.

The source also comes with a way to easily extract code coverage
information too, simply by typing `make coverage`.

* 1.0.0 - <2013-06-28 Fri>

Initial public release.
