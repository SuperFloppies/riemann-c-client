Description: C language client library for the Riemann event stream processor
 Riemann is a network event stream processor, intended for analyitics,
 metrics and alerting; and to glue various monitoring systems together.
 .
 This library provides a C language client, with a simple but
 convenient API, to connect to Riemann, send events and run queries
 against it.

Description: Development files for the Riemann C client library
 The riemann-c-client library provides a C language client, with a
 simple but convenient API, to connect to Riemann, send events and run
 queries against it
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs linked against
 librliemann-client0, as only this includes the header files and
 static libraries needed for compiling.
